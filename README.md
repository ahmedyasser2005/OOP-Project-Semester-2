# "Scholarship Search Engine (formerly Study-Finder)", OOP Project

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ console application developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course at Galala University. It manages scholarships, user accounts, and university details using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Features
User and Account Management:
Handles various types of accounts, including general user accounts and specialized bankAccount and studyFinderAccount types.

University and Scholarship Search:
Allows users to search for available scholarships linked to specific universities. Implemented through a class-based structure.

User-Friendly Interface:
Designed with ANSI color codes and a menu-driven console interface for easy navigation and interaction.

Error Handling:
Robust input validation and error messaging system to ensure smooth user experience.

## Class Structure
The project uses a multi-level class hierarchy with key classes as follows:

person:
Base class representing an individual, potentially a scholarship applicant or account holder.

account:
Base class for handling general account-related operations.

bankAccount:
Inherits from account and manages financial operations related to the user's account.

studyFinderAccount:
Specialized class for managing scholarship-related details and search functions.

university:
Class representing universities, storing information that allows users to search for scholarships linked to them.

## Technologies Used
C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Inheritance and Polymorphism
Vectors for data storage
Console I/O and ANSI color codes for the user interface
